## Raspberry Assistant

### Foreword

This blog is mainly about the introduction, configuration and function about Raspberry Pi for people who are interested in it. Frankly I am also just a beginner. So I am willing to write down my experiences about my project on Raspberry Pi for recording and sharing. I hope that with this blog we can learn together. Please do not hesitate to discuss or point out my errors. If you like it, please press the "Star" button to support me, thank you!
